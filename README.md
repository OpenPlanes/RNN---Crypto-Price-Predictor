# RNN - Crypto Price Predictor
 RNN stands for recurrent neural network. The idea of the recurrent neural network is that sequences and orders matter
 Improving my knowledge of RNN by predicting Crypto Price
 Specifically focusing on sequence of features
 A pretty common time-series dataset will be stocks.
 However, I wanted to explore crypto instead and see the market changes.
 For the purpose of this project I wanted to only focus on Closing Price and Volume.
 The theory is that crypto have relationships with each other. 
 Is there a possibility that we could analyze the future movements of crypto by analysing the last 60 minutes of prices and volumes for the said coin
 
 1. Clean, Combine datasets to measure targets
 2. Balance Dataset
 3. Scale/normalize the Dataset
 4. Create out of sample data
 5. analyze the accuracy of the RNN
